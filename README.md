# Slack - UX Redesign

## Overview
Slack is widely used in our school across a wide range of disciplines. In design classes, students post their work and receive peer feedback; In engineering classes, students discuss about their group projects. 

I have decided to redesign the mobile Slack’s Thread feature by 
* **making the interface more accessible**
* **adding one functionality**

in order to make browsing and searching more efficient.

## Research
I conducted user study by interviewing eight people. The distribution is shown as below.

* **Have you ever used Slack?**

Among the six people who have used it, 
* **What is your familiarity with Slack?**

* **What is your role when using Slack?**

* **What class do you use it for?**

Through user study, I find that people use mobile Slack Thread for **heavy text-based conversation** and **viewing pictures**. For either purpose, they reflect that there is some inconvenience. To facilitate users to browse through wordy conversation, I decide to change the **layout of Thread**; To help users find target pictures quickly, I decide to **create a shortcut**.

### Problem 1
#### Go to another screen to view all replies
One of the teaching assistants pointed out that people have to click on the “+replies” and then enter into a new screen to read the complete list of replies. As he is obliged to read every thread, he felt doing so pretty annoying. Other Slack users among my interviewees had the same opinion. When I brought the issue to those two people who have not used Slack, they also claimed they would not want to check the replies.

### Solution 
#### Expand to open a thread; Add button as cue for editing
**iteration 1** <br>
By clicking on a message, the user could expand a dropdown list of replies instead of entering into a whole new screen. The position of the message may be pushed up a bit to create enough space for the replies. The current message and its replies are marked grey to be differed from other messages.
